This page is part of a course that will help others NYCH collaborators identify how to conduct and develop online programs to attend the community.

I made this exercise using react to display and hide the answers and help the user to practice some concepts.

The user must click on the button with the correct answer that completes the sentence.

If the answer is correct, the button will disappear, and the following sentence will appear on the screen.

After completing all the phrases, the screen will display the success message and a box with all the sentences. The restart button refreshes the page and restarts the exercise.
